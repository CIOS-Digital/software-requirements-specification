\section{Overall Description}
  This section gives an overview of the proposed functionality of the product.
  It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical
  requirements specification in the next section.
  \subsection{Product Perspective}
    This flight planning editor addresses a CAP emergency flight planning need.
    Specifically, this new software whill allow a user to input latitude and longitude coordinates
    and view them on a map to develop flight plans.
    These flight plans can then be used in the Garmin G1000 navigation system.
  \subsection{Product Features}
    The most important feature of this product is the ability to read, edit, and write XML containing flight plans.
    This is accomplished through a user interface in which allow the user will enter coordinates which are then
    displayed on a map for reviewing and modification.
    Once the flight plan is finished, the user can save their plan to the SD card to be used in the G1000.
  \subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
    There is only one type of user that will interact with the system:
    users that have the authority to create flight-plans.
    In the case of the Bellingham CAP, this is limited to two people.
    The user is expected to have knowledge of flying area and can read charts.
    The user shall also be expected to have lattitude-longitude coordinates of
    waypoints of interest to include in the flight plan.
  \subsection{Operating Environment}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|} \hline
      OE-1: & The Flight Plan Editor shall operate with the following operating systems:
              Microsoft Windows 7, Microsoft Windows 8 and Microsoft Windows 10. \\ \hline

    \newpage
\section{System Features}
  \subsection{Display Sectional Map}
    \subsubsection{Description and Priority}
      The application will display the sectional map as the main interface.
      The map will respond to input from lattitude/longitude coordinate input as well
      as having the ability to pan around the map.
    \subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
      \begin{description}
        \item[Stimulus] A user can request to create a new waypoint.
		\item[Response]	The sectional map will create a new point on the map to
			reflect the changes made.
		\item[Stimulus] A user can also click on the map and drag their mouse
			across the screen.
    \item[Response] The program will adjust the view of the map vertically and horizontally,
			in the opposite direction of the mouse pointers movement.
		\item[Stimulus] A user may also scroll with the mousewheel.
		\item[Response] The map will either zoom in or zoom out depending on the mouse scroll.
      \end{description}
    \subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|} \hline
      FR-1: & Upon starting the program, the sectional map will be displayed\\ \hline
      FR-2: & This map will have the ability to maneuver and pan based upon user mouse movement\\ \hline
      FR-3: & Map will also respond to changes in waypoints, or selecting different flight plans\\ \hline
      \end{tabularx}

  \subsection{Input Destination Coordinates}

    \subsubsection{Description and Priority}
		In the top left corner of the application, there are two input windows for
		lattitude/longitude coordinate input. Once the user enters the data,
		points on the sectional map will appear as well as a text list for each
		coordinate. Priority = high.
    \subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
      \begin{description}
        \item[Stimulus] User will click on the lattitude text box to input the
			lattitude, and complete the same for longitude.
		\item[Response] Upon completion, the user will hit the enter key on their
			keyboard, and the map shall display the point respective
			to the lattitude/longitude input.
		\item[Stimulus] User can then request to edit an existing waypoint.
		\item[Response] The coordinate is displayed, and user will have the option to
			either save or discard the changes.
      \end{description}
    \subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|} \hline
      FR-4: & There will be a text input box for both lattitude and longtitude coordinate input\\ \hline
      FR-5: & Upon entering coordinates, a waypoint will be drawn on the sectional map to represent its location\\ \hline
      FR-6: & Selecting an already created waypoint allows the user to modify the coordinates, or discard the waypoint\\ \hline
      \end{tabularx}

    \subsection{Distinguish Waypoint Coordinates}
      \subsubsection{Description and Priority}
		As a user inputs more lattitude/longitude coordinates, the program will
	    draw a new waypoint onto the sectional map for viewing as well
		as having a small subtext containing the lattitude/longitude coordinates
		for viewing to distinguish each waypoint. Priority = medium.
      \subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
        \begin{description}
          \item[Stimulus] A user can request to view the listed waypoints on the map.
		  \item[Response] The program will display the lattitude/longitude data
			for that given point on the sectional map, as well as highlight the
			list of waypoints that were already added to that particular flight
			plan.
        \end{description}
      \subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
      \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|} \hline
        FR-7: & Each waypoint drawn on the map shall display the lattitude and longitude coordinates\\ \hline
        FR-8: & Each waypoint will also be displayed as a list between other points for connections\\ \hline
        \end{tabularx}


      \subsection{Draw Flight Path on Section Map Between Coordinates}
        \subsubsection{Description and Priority}
        		The user should have the ability to not only add or delete points, but change in which
        		order he connects one point to another. This allows the user to actually route between
        		points rather than have to manually navigate between them. (Priority = High)
        \subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
            Upon selection/editing a flight plan, the program will pull up a list of previous flight
            points and the path between them on a map. These points will be pathed in the order the
            appear on the list, and changing the order will change what point each point connects to.
            The user will be able to see this editing of order (and thereby flight path) automatically
            on the map.
        \subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
          \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|} \hline
            FR-9: & The point list shall have ability to edit ordering of lat/long coordinates\\ \hline
            FR-10: & If adding new lat/long coordinates, the previous coord will connect to new one.\\ \hline
            FR-11: & If coordinate is last on list, the path will end there.\\ \hline
      	    FR-12: & The map shall update to show new path as the list is edited/extended.\\ \hline
          \end{tabularx}
        \subsection{Open and Save Flight Plan in XML to SD Card}
          \subsubsection{Description and Priority}
            The Garmin G1000 uses SD cards to store flight plans, and does so in the XML format.
            For this program to be of any use, it \emph{must} support reading and writing these files.
            Priority = High
          \subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
            \paragraph{Opening a file:}
            \begin{description}
              \item[Step 1] User initiates an open action.
              \item[Step 1.1] If the user has an unsaved, open flight plan, prompt the user if they want to save it.
                If the user chooses to save the plan, complete the `saving a file' section before continuing.
              \item[Step 2] User is prompted to select a file to open.
              \item[Step 3] The file is deserialized and displayed.
              \item[Step 3.1] If the file is invalid, corrupt, or otherwise fails to open, display a warning to the user.
            \end{description}
            \paragraph{Saving a file:}
            \begin{description}
              \item[Step 1] User initiates a save action or a save-as action.
              \item[Step 2] If the user selected a save-as action, or if the current plan is not already associated with a file,
                the user selects the file location and file name they would like to use.
              \item[Step 3] The current flight plan is serialized to XML, and written to the file.
              \item[Step 4] After writing the file completes, a message is displayed to alert the user.
            \end{description}
          \subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
